## Improvement ideas

- [ ]  Remove JQuery. It is heavier than needed. Maybe later. I should have built without it, but not much benefit to removing it now.
- [ ]  Inconsolata font doesn't show up on Edge.
- [ ]  Make a length limit for the number displayed on the calculator screen.
- [ ]  Make it more mobile friendly.

## Project Requirements

User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.

User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
