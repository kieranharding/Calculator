See it on [Github](https://kieranharding.github.io/Calculator)

## Roadmap

- [ ]  Remove JQuery. It is heavier than needed. Maybe later. I should have built without it, but not much benefit to removing it now.
- [x]  Switch to using javascript.eval() or some other method to preserve order of operations. Keep displaying "current" value.
- [x]  Create a style.
- [x]  Prevent adding more than one decimal.
- [x]  AC Clear All; CE Clear Entry. On result, CE clears screen.
- [ ]  Inconsolata font doesn't show up on Edge.

## Project Requirements

User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.

User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
